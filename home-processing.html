            <h1>Processing at home</h1>
            <p>
                For processing at home, consider the <a href="https://cinestillfilm.com/products/cs2-cine-simplified-ecn-2-bath-kit-low-contrast-motion-picture-color-negatives-for-ecp-scanning?variant=32487168344138" target="_blank">Cinestill Cs2 kit</a>, which
                simplifies the ECN-2 process into just two bathes. <br>
                <i>Note: Sensiometric tests have shown the Cn2 developer (present in the Cs2 kit) to be weaker
                    than advertised. While it produces great results, we suggest pushing all
                    films 1 stop to compensate the weakness of this developer and achieve results
                    indistinguishable from ECN-2 processed films. This is not an issue with the films, but the
                    Cinestill Cn2 developer specifically.

            <h2>Fancy Black & White?</h2>
            <p>
                Vision3 films can be processed in black & white chemistry too.
                For 250D, use times intended for ISO 200 T-grain films and for 500T,
                use times intended for ISO 400 T-grain films.
                If you plan to reuse your chemicals, the Remjet layer should be
                removed <b>prior</b> to processing.
                To remove Remjet, agitate the film in a 10% Sodium Bicarbonate solution
                for 3 minutes, then keep rinsing until water comes out clear. Then proceed
                to usual black & white developing and fixing.
                <b>Note:</b> Cross-processing the film with B&W chemistry will yield more contrasty
                negatives, because of bleach bypass. The results are very pleasant.
